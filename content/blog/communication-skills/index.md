Few days back I came across a tweet by Swapnil (https://x.com/SwapAgarwal) where he tweeted about one of his mentee asked him about how he can improve his communication skills. So swapnil gave him 30 days challenge to record himself discussing a topic for 5 mins via loop.
Seeing the tweet it motivated me to do the experiment on myself.This blog will contain all the topics which will I record.
